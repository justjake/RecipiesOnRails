# Recipes on Rails

by [Jake Teton-Landis](http://jake.teton-landis.org)

A simple recipe database application, coming soon.
## Goals & features

	* **Mom-usable.** Easy and quick enough to use in everyday life.  Interface should be intuitive and iPad-like.
	* **Easy to find.** We spend so much time looking for that *one* recipe.  Searching for a recipe in our application should be faster than looking for it in meatspace.
	* **Stress Reducing.** Takes calculations and tracking off a user's mind.  A lofty goal.
	* **Durable.** Paper may crumble and books may be lost, but data can be backed up and tracked.
